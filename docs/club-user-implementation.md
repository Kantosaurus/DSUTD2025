# Club User Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new "club" user role with intermediate permissions between regular students and admins. Club users can create, edit, and delete events, with all events requiring admin approval.

## Database Changes

### 1. Updated User Roles
- Added 'club' to the user role enum
- Updated migration script: `backend/migrations/add_club_role_and_event_approval.sql`

### 2. Event Approval System
- Added `status` column to `calendar_events` ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')
- Added `approval_date`, `approved_by`, and `rejection_reason` columns
- Created `event_analytics` view for comprehensive event statistics

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Authentication Middleware (`backend/middleware/auth.js`)
- `requireClubOrAdmin`: Allows both club and admin users
- `requireAdminOrClubAdmin`: For approval actions (admin only for now)

### 2. Event Management API (`backend/routes/events.js`)
- `POST /api/events` - Create events (club users create as pending)
- `GET /api/events/my-events` - Get user's events with filtering
- `GET /api/events/:id/analytics` - Comprehensive event analytics
- `PUT /api/events/:id` - Update events (requires re-approval for club users)
- `DELETE /api/events/:id` - Delete events

### 3. Admin Approval API (`backend/routes/admin.js`)
- `GET /api/admin/events/pending` - Get pending events
- `POST /api/admin/events/:id/approve` - Approve events
- `POST /api/admin/events/:id/reject` - Reject events with reason
- `GET /api/admin/events/all` - Advanced filtering of all events
- `GET /api/admin/events/approval-stats` - Approval statistics

### 4. Updated Calendar API (`backend/routes/calendar.js`)
- Modified to only show approved events in public calendar

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Club Events Management (`frontend/app/club/events/page.tsx`)
- Comprehensive event management dashboard for club users
- Create, edit, delete events with real-time status tracking
- Event analytics with signup details and statistics
- Tabbed interface (All, Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- Modal forms for event creation/editing

### 2. Admin Event Approval (`frontend/app/admin/events/page.tsx`)
- Added `PendingEventsSection` component
- Approve/reject events with reasons
- Real-time pending events dashboard

### 3. Updated Navigation (`frontend/components/ui/resizable-navbar.tsx`)
- Role-based navigation filtering
- Club users see "My Events" link
- Students don't see club-specific items
